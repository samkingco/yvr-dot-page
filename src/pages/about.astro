      <h2 class="text-sm flex-1 font-bold">why?</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-tight">
        meeting new people in this city can be tough, especially if you're new. we wanted a place where we could find like-minded people who are into art, technology, music, and other creative pursits. a place where you could organize mini events, workshops, or just hang out at the park.

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-sm flex-1 font-bold">how?</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-tight">
        you can <a href="/submit" class="internal-link font-bold">submit</a> your profile info, and someone will review it and add you to the directory. if you want to meet others, their websites or social profiles are linked in the directory. we may add a way for people to message each other from the directory, but for now, just use the websites.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-sm flex-1 font-bold">vibe check?</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-tight">
        every person in the directory has been vetted by a few people already in the community. we want to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and safe meeting up with each other. we're keeping the community relatively small to start, but we're open to ideas on how to improve the vibe check over time, and increase the size of the group.
